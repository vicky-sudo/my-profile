				<h2>My Experiences</h2>

				<h3>McDonald's (Full-Time Job)</h3>
				<p>I worked there for about 2 years and then I quit when I went to Taco Bell. McDonald's is an alright job if you want quick cash, but not for a long time period. </p>

				<h3>Taco Bell (Full-Time Job)</h3>
				<p>I worked at this job for about more than 8 months to say the least. I was a good job, something quick and a nice change of pace, even though it's still in the fast food industry.</p>
				
				<h3>Hidden Components ( Part-Time Job)</h3>
				<p>I started this job recently at the start of my stay in Singapore. I started in November and I'mn still working there to this day. I work as a bartender and a waitress.</p>
